🌿 Plant Disease Detection Model

This project is a Plant Disease Detection System built using Machine Learning / Deep Learning techniques.
The model identifies diseases in plant leaves from images and helps farmers or agricultural researchers detect issues early.

📌 Project Overview

Plant diseases reduce crop productivity and cause major losses in agriculture.
This project uses Computer Vision + AI to classify leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.

The system can:

Detect plant diseases from leaf images

Classify multiple disease categories

Provide quick and automated diagnosis

🚀 Features

✅ Image-based plant disease classification
✅ Deep Learning model trained on leaf dataset
✅ Supports multiple disease classes
✅ Easy-to-use prediction pipeline
✅ Can be deployed as a web or mobile app
